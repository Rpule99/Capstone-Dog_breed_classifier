## Project Overview

This project aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) first to classify images of dogs and predict the dog’s breed. The code used in this project can be viewed on GitHub

CNNs are machine learning algorithms that mimic how human neurons work to identify phenomena and weigh options to conclude. Neural networks are typically used in problems that aim to achieve artificial intelligence, processes which humans can learn and identify from memory. In this problem, identifying dog breeds may be achievable by a human if and when they have learned the characteristics of different dog breeds. The same concept applies here where we aim to teach the CNN model how to identify and classify dogs based on their characteristics.

Such models are great for facial recognition, autonomous driving, and image classification to name a few, and in this particular project, the resulting model could be used by people who would like to get a specific dog but are unable to name the breed.

The project scope will be limited to creating such a model using transfer learning to first identify if an image contains a human or a dog, and if a dog is identified, then specify its breed.

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

5. (Optional) __If you plan to install TensorFlow with GPU support on your local machine__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using an EC2 GPU instance, you can skip this step.

6. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create (and activate) a new environment.

	- __Linux__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-linux.yml` to `requirements/dog-linux-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-linux.yml
	source activate dog-project
	```  
	- __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-mac.yml` to `requirements/dog-mac-gpu.yml`): 
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-mac.yml
	source activate dog-project
	```  
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/dog-windows.yml` to `requirements/dog-windows-gpu.yml`):  
	```
	conda env create -f requirements/dog-windows.yml
	activate dog-project
	```

7. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)** and Step 6 throws errors, try this __alternative__ step to create your environment.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`): 
	```
	conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
	source activate dog-project
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	**NOTE:** Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV
	```
	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
	```
	- __Windows__ (to install with __GPU support__, change `requirements/requirements.txt` to `requirements/requirements-gpu.txt`):  
	```
	conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
	activate dog-project
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	```
	
8. (Optional) **If you are using AWS**, install Tensorflow.
```
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-gpu.txt
```
	
9. Switch [Keras backend](https://keras.io/backend/) to TensorFlow.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
		```
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
		```
	- __Windows__: 
		```
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
		```

10. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `dog-project` environment. 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dog-project --display-name "dog-project"
```

11. Open the notebook.
```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

12. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, before running code, change the kernel to match the dog-project environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > dog-project**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__

## Project Libraries

To run this project the following packages and libraries are required.
- Sklearn: ML package used for training and improving the model and to read data files.
- pandas: this will assist in manipulating the data and training model.
- glob: for searching files.
- matplot: for creating plots.
- CV2: for face detection model.
- keras: For the TensorFlow pre-trained models and image preprocessing.

## Project Files

- Root Directory:
    - bottleneck_features:
        folder to store bottleneck features (not uploaded due to size but can be download, see project instructions
    - dogImages:
        stores dog training, validation and testing images
    - Models
        - data_saver.py: module to save data into a db 
        - new_best_model.pkl: Pickle file which stars the saved model
        - train_classifier: trains and saves the classifier model

## Project Submission

When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.
- Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. __Please do not include the project data sets in the `dogImages/` or `lfw/` folders.  Likewise, please do not include the `bottleneck_features/` folder.__

Alternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.
